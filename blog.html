                    <h3>My Cute Dog, Cookie</h3>
                    <p class="byline">2023 July 20</p>
                    <p>Hello, everyone! Today, I'm going to talk about my very cute pet dog named Cookie. I first met her when I came to China. At that time she was a puppy so she was very small. She always wanted to go on walks and play with me. Now, she is a year old and has grown a lot. She loves to play with me even more than in the past. I hope that you are be able to see my pet dog Cookie someday.</p>

                    <h3> My Favorite Girl Group, New Jeans</h3>
                    <p class="byline">2023 July 20</p>
                    <p>My favorite girl group is NewJeans. This group belongs to the label Hybe and makes a lot of unique and good songs. Their group has five members, whose names are Hanni, Minji, Haerin, and Hyein. Their voices and songs have a special energy which inspires the listeners. That's why I like NewJeans and its members very much. I like all of their songs and my favorite song is OMG. I hope that you would be able to listen to it.</p>
